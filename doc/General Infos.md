This page gives an overview over all concepts, different configuration and other peculiarities
of `amiroCI`.

## Overview
The execution process of `amiroCI` is roughly grouped in **two stages**, the **configuration** and the **test pipeline**.

During the **configuration stage** a so called [_replacement config (r-conf)_](#replacement-configuration) is used to generate a [_configuration matrix (c-mat)_](#configuration-matrix).

The _c-mat_ is used by the **test pipeline stage** to create configured modules with the desired test parameters.
Subsequently those modules are compiled.
For each module an entry is added to [_global report_ ]().

Finally the generated report can be compared to an existing report, showing all non matching entries in the
[_comparison report_]()


## Configuration Matrix (_c-mat_)
A _c-mat_ is generated by the [_c-conf_](#replacement-configuration) and contains all test cases for the **compilation pipeline**.
```
OS_CFG_DBG   OS_CFG_TESTS_ENABLE  OS_CFG_PROFILE  OS_CFG_MAIN_LOOP_TIMEOUT [...]
true         true                 true            0
false        true                 true            0
true         false                true            0
true         true                 false           0
[...]
```
It is possible to edit the _c-mat_ with any exel program you like and create a custom
testing scenario.
**However, it is important to preserve the columns!**
You might also consider to use the [option groups](#option-groups) for a more fine grained _c-mat_ generation.

## Replacement Configuration (_r-conf_)
The _r-conf_ is intended to generate a configuration matrix.
This matrix can be edited and passed on to `amiroCI` in order to build all configurations listed.
The yaml config specifies what configurations to use for building the matrix.
All tags allowed are listed in the example below:

```yaml
# List of module names used for the test pipeline
Modules: ['DiWheelDrive_1-1']
# List of apps used for the pipeline
Apps: []

# Option Group Filter:
# Include or exclude specific groups
# Both take the hierarchy into account:
#   Include a subgroup requires including its parent
#   Excluding a parent means excluding its subgroups
IncludeGroups: []
ExcludeGroups: []

# Exclude combinations not matching the requirements
Dependencies:
  OS_CFG_TESTS_ENABLE:
    with_value: 'true'
    requires:
      OS_CFG_SHELL_ENABLE: 'true'

# Contains all option groups
Options:
    # Option or parent group
    AosconfOptionGroup:
        # Flag/Option passed to the compiler
        OS_CFG_DBG: ['true', 'false']
    UrtOptionGroup:
        ENABLE_TEST_MODE: ['true']
        # Subgroup or childgroup
        TestSetup:
            TEST_VLA1: [42, 100]
```
### `Apps`
* Used for Amiro-Apps build
* Is combined with `Modules`
* Leave it empty if the build only affects the Amiro-OS

### `Option` Groups
This tag contains all option groups used for generating _c-mat_.

* Consist of name followed by list of strings
* The values in the list are the configuration values used for the matrix
