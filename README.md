# Configuration Builder and Tester
This tool is intended to detect conditional compilations, extract the specific flag
for a given module (aka directory) and store those in a database.
Furthermore, the extracted compilation parameters are used to create module specific configurations that
are used to build the project.
All possible combinations are tested. The results are saved and compared to a user provided configuration with
known errors and warnings.
Therefore, changes that cause undesired behavior for specific builds can be detected.
